# A Density-based Approach for Querying Informative Constraints for Clustering
With constrained clustering, the quality of results can be improved by using constraints if a high-quality set of constraints is selected. Querying beneficial constraints is a challenging task because there is no metric for measuring the quality of constraints before clustering. A new method is proposed in this study (Abin and Vu, 2020) that estimates the density and impurity of data points on different adjacency distances and calculates centrality for each data point by applying a density tracking approach on the obtained densities. The obtained information is then used to select a set of high-quality constraints.
